	\brief COptionPage

	Objects of class COptionPage represent individual pages of a option
	sheet, otherwise known as a tab dialog box. As with standard dialog boxes,
	you derive a class from COptionPage for each page in your option
	sheet. To use COptionPage-derived objects, first create a COptionSheet
	object, and then create an object for each page that goes in the option
	sheet. Call COptionSheet::AddPage for each page in the sheet, and then
	display the option sheet by calling COptionSheet::DoModal for a modal
	option sheet, or COptionSheet::Create for a modeless option sheet.

	You can create a type of tab dialog box called a wizard, which consists of
	a option sheet with a sequence of option pages that guide the user
	through the steps of an operation, such as setting up a device or creating
	a newsletter. In a wizard-type tab dialog box, the option pages do not
	have tabs, and only one option page is visible at a time. Also, instead
	of having OK and Apply Now buttons, a wizard-type tab dialog box has a
	Back button, a Next or Finish button, and a Cancel button.
